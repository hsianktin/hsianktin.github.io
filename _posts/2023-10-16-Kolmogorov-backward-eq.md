Formally, Kolmogorov backward equation is identical to adjoint Fokker-Planck equation. However, they bear different interpretations.

We begin with the Heisenberg picture introduced in [A note on Langevin Equations and Stochastic Differential Equations](/blog/a-note-on-lange.html), i.e., adjoint Fokker-Planck equation with respect to a test function $u_0=u$.
Abstractly, $u_t$ and $\rho_t$, PDF of $X_t$ satisfy the following equations

$$
\partial_{t}u_t = \mathcal{L}^* u_t, \quad \partial_{t} \rho_t = \mathcal{L} u_t.
$$

Consider the green function $\mathcal{G}_t(x,x')$ such that

$$
\rho_t(x) = \int_{x'} \mathcal{G}_t(x,x') \rho_0(x')\mathrm{d} x'.
$$

Then, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\langle u_t, \rho_0 \rangle = \langle u, \rho_t \rangle &= \big\langle u(x), \langle \mathcal{G}_t(x, x'), \rho_0(x') \rangle \big\rangle\\
&= \left\langle \langle u(x), \mathcal{G}_t(x,x') \rangle, \rho_0(x')  \right\rangle
.
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing LHS and RHS, we have

$$
u_t(x) = \int_{x'} u(x') \mathcal{G}_t(x',x) \mathrm{d} x'
$$

Apply $\partial_{t}$ and $\mathcal{L}^*$ respectively to above equation to obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{x'} u(x') \mathcal{L}_{(x')} \mathcal{G}_t(x',x) \mathrm{d} x' &=
\int_{x'} u(x') \mathcal{L}_{(x)}^* \mathcal{G}_t(x',x) \mathrm{d} x'
\end{aligned}
\quad\forall  u.
$$

Since choice of $u$ is arbitrary, it entails that

$$
\mathcal{L}_{(x_t)} \mathcal{G}_t (x_t,x_0) = \mathcal{L}_{(x_0)}^* \mathcal{G}_t(x_t,x_0).
$$

Specifically, $\mathcal{G}_t$ satisfies the following equation:

$$
\partial_{t} \mathcal{G}_t(x_t,x) = \mathcal{L}^*_{(x)}  \mathcal{G}_t(x_t,x).
$$

With $x_t$ considered as a constant, this is more generally known as Kolmogorov backward equation.

At this moment, we shall see that both forward and backward equation characterize (different aspects of) the Green function, or probability evolution operator $\mathcal{G}_t$.
