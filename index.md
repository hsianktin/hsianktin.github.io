## Welcome

Greetings! I'm Xiangting Li, a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Medicine at UCLA advised by Prof. [Tom Chou](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tchou/index.html). My research orbits around the stochastic processes inherent in biological systems, with a spotlight on DNA-protein interactions across multiple scales. 

### Research Interests

I am deeply invested in unraveling the stochastic processes inherent in biological systems, particularly focusing on DNA-protein interactions across multiple scales. My research encompasses a multidisciplinary approach, blending statistical physics, biomathematics, and computational methodologies to decode the complex dynamics governing molecular interactions in cellular environments.

My work at UCLA delves into the stochastic dynamics of DNA-protein interactions, aiming to bridge the understanding between microscopic molecular interactions and macroscopic biological phenomena. Through this lens, I explore various facets of molecular biology, including nucleosome disassembly, transcription-translation coupling, and the mechanisms underlying viral evolution.
