## Welcome

Hello! My name is Xiangting Li and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in
biomathematics at UCLA, advised by Prof. [Tom
Chou](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tchou/index.html). My research
focuses on understanding the stochastic processes that occur in
biological systems, particularly diving into how DNA and proteins
interact across different scales.

### Research Interests

My interest lies in dissecting the stochastic processes present in
biological systems, with a special emphasis on DNA-protein
interactions spanning multiple scales. My approach is a fusion of
statistical physics, mathematics, and computational techniques, all
aimed at elucidating the deterministic and stochastic dynamics that dictate molecular
interactions from a semi-analytical perspective.

At UCLA, my work is focused on characterizing the stochastic dynamics
of DNA-protein interactions. The goal is to create a link between the
microscopic interactions occurring at the molecular level and the
macroscopic phenomena observed in biology. In pursuit of this goal, I have
explored various models of molecular biology, such as nucleosome
disassembly, the coupled processes of transcription and translation,
and understanding the driving forces behind viral evolution.

I am also interested in the development of computational tools to aid
in the analysis of biological data, with a particular flavor on
inferring first principles from experimental data using a top-down
approach.
