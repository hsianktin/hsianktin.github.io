## Welcome

Hello! My name is Xiangting Li and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in
biomathematics at UCLA, advised by Prof. [Tom
Chou](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tchou/index.html). My research
focuses on understanding the stochastic processes that occur in
biological systems, particularly diving into how DNA and proteins
interact across different scales.

I also develop tools to facilitate research itself, such as [citation
crawler](https://github.com/hsianktin/paper_network_builder), a [tool]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/citation-crawler.html) 
to build [interactive](assets/citation_crawler.html) network of papers based on citation information.

### General Interests

My interest lies in dissecting the stochastic processes present in
biological systems, with a special emphasis on DNA-protein
interactions spanning multiple scales. My approach is a fusion of
statistical physics, mathematics, and computational techniques, all
aimed at elucidating the deterministic and stochastic dynamics that
dictate molecular interactions from a semi-analytical perspective.

I received my B.S. in the Integrated Science Program at Peking
University. The program provided me with a broad and relatively
in-depth exposure to mathematics (analysis, geometry, topology,
dynamical systems, and probability), physics (statistical mechanics),
physical chemistry, and biology (molecular, developmental, and
evolutionary biology). Beyond the training in the classroom, I managed
to appreciate different research fields from perspectives of a
mathematician, a physicist, and a biologist. Even for the same problem
of Brownian motion and Langevin equation, the physical approach and
the mathematical approach are quite different in the formalism, see my
blog post [A note on Langevin Equations and Stochastic Differential
Equations](/blog/a-note-on-lange.html) for more details.

During my undergraduate years, I worked with Prof. [Zhi Qi (齐
志)](https://cqb.pku.edu.cn/qizhi/) on the single-molecule biophysics
topics. I worked as both a theorist and an experimentalist, and
developed a strong interest in the stochastic processes that occur in
biological systems. 

At UCLA, my work is focused on characterizing the stochastic dynamics
of DNA-protein interactions. The goal is to create a link between the
microscopic interactions occurring at the molecular level and the
macroscopic phenomena observed in biology. In pursuit of this goal, I
have explored various models of molecular biology, such as nucleosome
disassembly, the coupled processes of transcription and translation,
and understanding the driving forces behind viral evolution.

I am also interested in the development of computational tools to aid
in the analysis of biological data, with a particular flavor on
inferring first principles from experimental data using a top-down
approach.
